The main purpose of the program is to make the creation of quotes a quick and easy process for the aluminum worker. Each quote displays a customer's information
as well the products that will be used in construction. The special feature of this program is that it generates a visualization of each product using it's 
description as reference. This was previously done by hand for each product, which could take from several minutes up to a couple of hours depending on the size of 
the proyect. With this program that time is cut to just a few seconds per product or a few minutes per quote.
